#  SwiftUI2 - Updated Memorize app from Stanford CS193p course by Paul Hegarty
This app is an update to the "Memorize" app made by followind the 2020 CS193p course from Stanford University by Paul Hegarty and I claim no rights or deserve any credit for it.
It uses the MVVM design pattern. You can check out the full course from Stanford here: [https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu) 

I just updated the Grid with the simpler LazyVGrid introduced in SwiftUI 2 and renamed some of the structs and classes.
